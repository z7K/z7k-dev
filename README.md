Dev Repo for Unity Projects

The initial project will be based on the occupation of countries/regions. When you become in control of a city etc. you will be taken to a map screen where the ground covered grows to your new area. Different sized cities/towns/villages will have varying resistance to your assault and varying amount of damage it takes to either damage the city to the extent of which it is rubble or make them surrender the city.

The game will allow the user to select which country they want to be, and which country they would like to begin their conquest with. A nice map screen is definitely required as this will be seen a lot. Procedural city generation can be used if the game becomes fully free roam but in other cases - pre loaded cities with seamless transitions will be used.

The user will be able to control divisions of infantry, tanks, navy (if coastal city) and air vehicles including strafing runs and just general air support.

These are the main aims.
